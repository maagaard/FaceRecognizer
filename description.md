## Large-Margin Nearest Neighbours

- SÃ¸ren is in 321, door 009

### Overview 
- Distance metric used to identify nearest neighbours
    - Metric adapted to problem being solved -> Find good metric for faces
    - Learn metric from labeled examples. Is that possible?
    - Use only relevant parts of image (faces and not background)

- Possible tasks:
    1. Which person is this?
    2. Is this the same person as this?

- Learn good distance measures between features
    - Come up with a matrix that makes the distance measure better
    - A change of basis (new coordinate system for feature vector)

### Plan 
- Read chapter 2 in Bishop
- Read the research paper ["Distance Metric Learning for Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification"](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume10/weinberger09a/weinberger09a.pdf)
- Download [data](https://lrs.icg.tugraz.at/research/kissme/)
- Implement kNN with Euclidian distance and run it
    - Optimize
- Research on key image points for faces
