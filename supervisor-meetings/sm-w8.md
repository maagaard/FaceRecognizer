# Advanced Machine Learning 02460 - Project
## Supervisor meeting - Week 8
**28-04-2016**

### Agenda
1. Stochastic gradient descent
2. Olivetti data set
3.



## Minutes
- Maybe apply metric to data and visualize the transformed data (faces)
    - Understand what the computer uses for recognizing the faces
- In general, more visualization
- Maybe use eigen value decomposition of metric to visualize 


### Deadlines

- Poster exam 19th of may
- Report one week later (26th of may)
- Use poster presentation as feedback for report corrections

### Discussion for report
- Other ways of learning metric, e.g. inverse covariance matrix
- Non-convex optimizing problems vs convex
    - e.g. large margin largest component

- Discuss the implication of the complexity of data (dimensions) 

- Experiments with values of `K` 
- Experiments with active set frequency update

- Further work for this concrete problem
    - Cross validation of parameters
    - Only solves *this* problem
