# Advanced Machine Learning 02460 - Project
## Supervisor meeting - Week 5
**07-04-2016**

### Agenda
1. Progress / status
    * Show "results"
    * Question about algorithm
2. Project delimitation and learning goals
3. Plan


### Minutes


- The algorithm
    - Targets need to be fixed for all iterations. This explains the behavior of the loss function.
        - This is key point of understanding the algorithm! Write a bit about this..

    - Maybe run algorithm to converging, then use new metric to compute new targets and run algorithm again

    - Margin: Probably keep margin fixed
    - Standardize data input - use inverse covariance matrix

- Project delimitation
    - Implement LMNN algorithm
    - Implement algorithm using active sets
    - Have algorithm run on large data sets
        - Scaling of data
        - Other optimizing in order to have this perform well

    - (If time allows, maybe try using 1-norm - Only  maybe!)
    

- Learning goals
    - Explain Large Margin Nearest Neighbors
        - Including the meaning of the metric
    - Implement LMNN
    - Explain and implement active sets
    - (Explain convex problem of LMNN)?? 


- Report
    - What did we do, what does our algorithm do, how did we implement it
    - How are others doing this? What other methods could be used for solving our problem? (Maybe focus on one or two others)

- Refine project delimitation and learning goals and get them verified by Søren

- The next week Søren is occupied. Maybe we can have short meeting if it is really needed. Can be reached at hauberg@gmail.com
- The week after is Søren away, but we can have a Skype-meeting instead.
