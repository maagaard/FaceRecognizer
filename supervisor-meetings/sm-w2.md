# Advanced Machine Learning 02460 - Project
## Supervisor meeting - Week 2 
**10-03-2016**

### Agenda
1. Progress / status
2. Plan
3. Delimitation
4. Learning objectives

### Minutes
1. 
2. Implement learning algorithm
    - Small data set (2 dimensions ~100 samples)
    - Get something working
    - Evaluate "hacks" in algorithm that are implemented to lowers computation time
    - Major tasks
        - Compute gradient (careful bookkeeping of targets and impostors)
        - Maybe look at energy of cost function

3. Agree on this after easter, bring preliminary delimitation
4. Agree on this after easter, bring preliminary goals and objectives
