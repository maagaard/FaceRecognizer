# Advanced Machine Learning 02460 - Project
## Project meeting - Week 2 
**10-03-2016**


## Overview
- Lisa was ill, but read from home.
- Emil and Morten were present.


# Progress since last time
- Simple knn has been implemented and everyone has read the report.

# Today
- We ran the kNN algorithm and looked at optimization
- After meeting with Søren, we agreed on goals for the next couple of times. 
- The primary goal is to get a primitive version of the main algorithm up and running (ie. no active sets  or other fancy stuff). 
- First step is to implement the gradient and then build the rest of the algorithm.

- The gradient has been implemented and most functions for the main algorithm are completed.


# Work for next week. 
- Implement the main algorithm (one big for-loop around everything, renaming of variables).
- Visualize results
- Implement the loss function and alter alpha dynamically.
- Optionally optimize
