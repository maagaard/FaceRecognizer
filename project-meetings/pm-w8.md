# Advanced Machine Learning 02460 - Project
## Project meeting - Week 8
**28-04-2016**


# Progress since last time
- Olivetti face data set seems more appropriate to work with as it is actually feasible to run 
    - Insert image



# Today
- Data
    - More experimentation with Olivetti
    - Maybe try with MNIST handwritten digits
- Algorithm
    - Stochastic gradient descent
- Show the implication and speed up of using active sets
    - The "big" run vs the small updates
- Experiment with K

# Considerations
