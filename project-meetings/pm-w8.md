# Advanced Machine Learning 02460 - Project
## Project meeting - Week 8
**28-04-2016**


# Progress since last time
- Olivetti face data set seems more appropriate to work with as it is actually feasible to run 
    - Insert image



# Today
- Data
    - More experimentation with Olivetti
    - Maybe try with MNIST handwritten digits
- Algorithm
    - Stochastic gradient descent
- Show the implication and speed up of using active sets
    - The "big" run vs the small updates
- Experiment with K


## Report results and experiments
- Fisher's Iris data
    - Visualization of margin and learning of metric 
    
- Classification with metric vs KNN
    - In general classification comparisons
    - Maybe see if there are special cases where the metric are better than KNN, e.g. if the guy with classes are misqualified in the one where he doesn't wear glasses, and the metric helps recognizing him anyway?!
    - Classification with and without the learned metric

- Visualizing metric applied to "original data"
    - Maybe show incremental change over iterations
    - Show what the metric actually does to the data (image)

- Result of active set implementation vs full implementation
    - Compare convergence rates
    - Show experiments with different updating frequencies

- Timing in Matlab implementations
    - Optimizations
