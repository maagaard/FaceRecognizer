# Advanced Machine Learning 02460 - Project
## Project meeting - Week 4
**31-03-2016**


## Overview


<!-- # Progress since last time
-  -->

# Today
- We worked on the LMNN algorithm and currently have the following results:

![LMNN w4_1]

As can be seen on the figure above, the loss function shows some weird behavior after the first two iterations. This needs to be investigated further.

# Work for next week. 
- Optimize the algorithm
